                <p>
                  Wendy has been an important part of my life for many years, as friend,
                  colleague, creative partner, teacher and shaman and I couldn’t imagine
                  life without her. She has the most wonderful spirit of compassion,
                  empathy, patience, authenticity and joy and has helped me through many
                  periods of my life with such generosity of that spirit. When working with
                  the medicine Wendy is gentle but reassuring, deeply invested but with
                  the light touch of someone who trusts fully that she herself is being
                  supported in what she does, and helps to honour and guide those who
                  work with her with total commitment to their needs. In both working
                  with Wendy and holding space with her when she is working with others,
                  I have always felt blessed to be sharing the medicine with her. I cannot
                  recommend Wendy highly enough; she has brought so much into my life
                  and helped me navigate and grow into my life’s journey, and for that I will
                  be eternally grateful.

                  Wendy gently guides you through the healing process that your very being is calling for. Holding space with such beauty and knowledge gained from her own shamanic journey of healing. With a wonderful range of healing processes to call upon there is always something that suits your needs. I myself have journeyed, had my energy revived, held ceremony with cacao and have had deep wounds repaired and the balance restored. Wendy is truly a remarkable and exceptionally knowledgeable healer and teacher. With her guidance you will begin your own journey of healing and learning.

                  Wendy carries her medicine with absolute integrity.  Throughout our journey together around the medicine wheel, Wendy has always looked to deepen her understanding and integration of the shamanic wisdom teachings.  With a beautiful sense of humor and a depth of compassion, Wendy creates a safe environment where her clients can feel heard and supported in their personal challenges and journeys. 
Wendy has a wealth of experience in a number of modalities and weaves these together beautifully to be in the best service for her clients.

                <p>
                  I have known and worked with Wendy for over 10 years.
We have worked and supported one another in our individual spiritual practices, even currently (during the lockdown), still sharing over a Zoom connection. Wendy is a powerful Angelic Reiki practitioner, which is my own personal field of expertise and I have no hesitation in wholeheartedly recommending her, for her knowledge, professionalism and dedication, both to her subject and to her clients and student's cares and well-being.

                <h4>Shamanic student, Norma Kershaw</h4>

                <p>
                  I came to seek the help of Wendy by kind advice. Initially due to a physical condition with which no amount of conventional intervention could solve.
The expectation was to seek a different path to eliminate and cure the pain I was suffering.
I was very sceptical to embark on this journey but decided that nothing ventured, nothing gained. To say the first visit changed my whole jaundiced perspective of what spiritual medicine was about was an understatement. My eyes and mind were opened to new possibilities.
The physical pain with which I had entered her medicine room was alleviated. I was now hooked onto travelling a new path of shamanic healing by this kind and caring lady.
Yes, it does work. After two years following this path, my life has been transformed from the spiritual teachings and experiences of the shamanic medicine wheel.
I have found how to bid farewell to my wounded past and discover a sacred space of spirit and joy and unite my body and soul.
I highly recommend Wendy to all those of you reading this testimonial.

                <p>
                  Wendy has taken me on my Shamanic healing journey every week over the last year both in person and online. I just love our sessions! Each one is completely different and contains another new gem (or gems) for me. 


I have learnt to properly tune in and connect with my heart and my true nature so much more than through years of mediation and ‘other routes’.


I’m continuously inspired by Wendy’s never-ending knowledge, her own Shamanic journey, her pearls of wisdom, her joyous character and her beautiful energy.  Wendy is the real deal!

                <p>
                  What can I say apart from Wendy is amazing!  Wendy has shown me such compassion and empathy, with no judgement at all.  She passionately believes in shamanic healing and has years of experience and has helped me greatly.  I would certainly recommend Wendy to anyone who may be struggling with personal issues.  Even those new to alternative therapy, I would say to just meet with Wendy for a chat as she never puts any pressure on you to book sessions but believe me, it works!

                <p>
                  I started working with Wendy about 3 years ago and through the work we have done I now live a more wholehearted, authentic, empowered, happy and fulfilled life. The work we have done has transformed my life and I am so grateful that I have had the opportunity and privilege to be guided, taught and mentored by Wendy, a wise and authentic shaman. Wendy’s knowledge, wisdom, skills and insights are second to none and I thank her for sharing her gifts and introducing me to the beauty and power of the Andean medicine wheel.
